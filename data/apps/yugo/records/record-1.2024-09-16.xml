The ICTY's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) issued its first indictment in November 1994. Between then and 2004, when the Security Council mandated the end of investigations as part of the ICTY's completion strategy, the OTP issued indictments against 161 individuals for crimes allegedly committed during the wars in Croatia (1991-1995), Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992-1995),
                                    Kosovo (1999) and North Macedonia (2001). In addition to the individuals from these countries, a number of people from Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (which comprised Serbia and Montenegro) were indicted for crimes allegedly committed in Croatia, BiH and Kosovo. </cmd:scopeAndContent>

                                    recordings of court hearings or other proceedings There is a catalogue entry for each of these types of records for each case. However, not all of these types of records were created for every case. Where no such records were created for the case in question, the relevant catalogue entry will note this. In addition to the Case File, a separate file was kept for correspondence related to the case (addressed to/from the Chamber, a Judge, a Party or a Non-Party)
                                    that was not submitted for filing or annexed to a filing as supporting material ("Correspondence File"). This correspondence was not part of the case record, but was maintained separately by the Court Management and Support Services Section.</cmd:systemOfArrangement>
